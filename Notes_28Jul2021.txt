if data is present only in html elements, it is difficult to loop
but the data has come from db table only and is displayed in the form of table

so when checkout button is clicked
	we can redirect to a page (checkoutcomp)
		diplaye
		Make payment
		it should make a textbox visible	
		We have sent an otp to your email address xxxxxx@yahoo.com
		........	submit otp
		if otp is correct 
			in .ts we can loop for as my cart items present in the cart as per db
		store those records in the order table

		

in angular validation
	call a rest api that 
		i) sends otp email
		ii) returns otp back to component

	obtained otp is stored in localstorage
	and when he click submit otp, we are not going to server. 
	we have otp in localstorage and 
		otp typed by the user in text box.		2 way binding, textbox value can be obtained
	compare both and say
		"Otp entered is incorrect"
		"Payment is successful"
		


place order button click will call a rest api
	controller
		has a method
		that will get all items in the cart
		loop the cart items
			add them to the order
