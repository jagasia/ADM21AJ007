Angular comes in front end
	what should be the back end?

	if you have a servlet, you cannot use it from angular.
	servlet is java code (binary)

	if you have a REST API, then we can access it from angular
		because, REST API is actually RESTful Web service

	any (SOAP/REST) web service can be accessed from any program of any language running in any platform
		because, REST produces and consumes data in standard format	(text)
		XML
		JSON
			Both XML and JSON are text format data (that has structure or schema)	

	REST APIs can be created using .net also		(not only java)
	if someone has created .net project REST API, it can be accessed from 
		angular

all practicals to be learnt first
after that lot of MCQ mocks to be done



comparison between monolithic application and microservices
--------------
	mono=single
	
	single layered application

example:
	MS Excel

	it provides
		UI
		logic
		data storage

	all the three services are provided by one process		(running instance of a program is process)

1) Presentation layer			User Interface		Front End
2) Business logic layer			Formula, validations, calculations, computations
3) Data layer				storage, retrieval, data mining

any enterprise application software has these 3 layers

if all these 3 layers are provided by a single process, then it is monolithic application

sometimes, MS Access also seen as a monolithic application. 
	bcos 
		FORM		for input output
		Constraints	for logic
		TABLES		for storage

	but it allows other applications like
		java programs to access the data

	it supports 2 tier
	3 tier and even n tier

java program		+		ms access db
	2 tier


important reason why monolithic is not ok

BookMyShow
	we can make payment
ICICI 

for payment service, bookmyshow borrow the functionality from icici bank

How icici share their code to bookmyshow??????????????
	they do not share their entire project
	they share only few methods 

this is where, the need for spliting our application into multiple layers started

Enterprises Integration
	Enterprise Application Integration

since you know REST controller
	you can relate this

	only 1 method is accessed using 1 url

	we are able to allow them to access in micro level




security
transaction


Feign client
---------------

we have created a REST API already				jar
	http://localhost:8080/food

Now, this is running in my server means
	http://upskillit.com/food

you can test it in post man

You have to create a spring boot MVC project
	and create food.jsp

controller		not REST controller

redirection and all these things are possible in MVC project	war

thymeleaf f/w
	html 

How will you make MVC project access the REST API?
	Feign Client



<form method="GET"
<form method="POST"

<form method="PUT"
<form method="DELETE"

WHAT IS THE USE OF PUT AND DELETE USED IN REST API?
	THEY WORK FINE IN
		POSTMAN
		ANGULAR SERVICE

MVC??????????????
How can i call rest api from controller 

Feign client is used by MVC project to access REST API

MVC project


for rest api
	5000 PORT number is AWS
	8080 DOES not work in aws when we deploye rest api

what we do?
	we transform the REST api urls into methods of interface in MVC project
	so that, mvc controllers, will call the methods rather than urls

first i am going to run the "food rest api" that we created yesterday
