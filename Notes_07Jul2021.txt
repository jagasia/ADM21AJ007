what is pipe?
			{{ employeeForm.value	|	json}}

here, value returns the object of employee form.
that object is transformed into json string using "json" pipe

similar to that pipe
there are lot pipes which are very useful

custom pipe
	i am going to create a pipe called "heading"
	if you give text, it will be displayed as a heading bold, center in red color

how to create a pipe?
	1) create a class that is decorated by @Pipe	and implements PipeTransform interface and override transform method
		and update the app.module.ts 	in declaration
	2) ng g pipe heading



  transform(value: unknown, ...args: unknown[]): unknown {
    return null;
  }


in typescript language param array is called as Rest parameter
