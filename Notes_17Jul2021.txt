If we use @Controller
	then we can use HttpSession object

@RequestMapping(....
public String method(ModelMap model, HttpSession session)
{}

if we store an object in model then it is available in the view that we redirect to. 
Will that object be available in all other views?????????
	NO

When i enter username and password in LOGIN page, i am entering only once. 
but in every other page, it should be remembered. Until i logout

so, we do not store the user credentials in Model, but  we store in HttpSession 
session.setAttribute("user",user");				user object contains username, role etc

so in any page, we can obtain the session object and understsand that he/she has logged in.

Welcome ${user.firstName}

This is possible in MVC projects (where we use @Controller)

Rest API do not use @Controller
	it uses @RestController

In REST API, every method is separate conversation
	there is no session

every rest api method is independent

So what can we do?
in Angular, 
	login page
	............
	............

if login is success or not?	hwo will you know?	by calling a rest api method
	rest api method	
		returns object of user means, login is successful
		returns null means, login is failure

	how will i keep this status persistent
	in angular, we use localStorage to keep an user object as JSON string

	var user=JSON.stringify(data);		user object obtained from rest api
	localStorage.setItem("user",user);


in every component, we first check if localStorage("user") is null or not. If null, then you have not logged in, click here to go to login page.		return. dont process further


html code is put inside <div *ngIf="status">		entire page will not be displayed if NOT logged in
			<div *ngIf="!status">You have not logged in. ple....to login</div>

MSA allows you to work independently
1) Entity class
2) Repository interface
3) Service class
4) Rest Controller

for every table, create a separate project
THis will be a separate micro service

Previous batch had interview

The interviewer always ask the participant to share their screen
	asked him/her to run the project

every entity is separate microservice




angular project is huge because of a folder "node_modules"
our project contains .ts files which cannot be understood by browsers
so .ts files must be compiled to become .js files (understood by browsers)

ng build
	this command is used to generate output of project
	dist folder will be created that contains only htmls and .js files



MovieMaster
		MOVIE_MASTER

spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
	THIS is used to control that strategy
	MOVIEMASTER will be the name

today

		entity, repo, service, controller 
		test it in postman



sprint
	is an unit of work

evening you are supposed to finish it

otherwise, this will be called as backlog tomoro morning


we dont need to login to GitLab directly to git lab portal

in tekstack we can login to gitlab



eureka server

every microservice 
	register itself to eureka server as a client

you will show the interviewer
	the eureka registry

	what are the services running

	repo

this is fine for master tables in the db

master table
	primary key		but there is no foreign key
	such tables are independent

details/transaction table

Attendance_Details
Student_Master

there are some tables
	master tables
	details tables

Details table
	has atleast one foreign key

	id
	name
	did

Department
	id
	name
	eid	NOT POSSIBLE

whenever a relationship ends with "Many"
	it will lead to another table 

to prevent that
	"mappedBy"

Employee
	id
	firstName
	lastName
	department		Department


Department
	id
	name
	employeeList		List<Employee>

	

ddlauto		update			create		drop-create

if table is not found, create it
if table is found with 3 columns.
	but our entity class has 4 columns
	that remaining 1 columns alone will be added to the table
	it will do updations
	data /records are not lost

create is rude
	if table already exists and records are there, 
	you lose records
	it will create again destroying existing table
