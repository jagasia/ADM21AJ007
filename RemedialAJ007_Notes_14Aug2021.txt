Core Java

data types:		There are 8 data types in java
boolean			1 bit
byte			8 bits		1 byte
short			16 bits		2 bytes
int			32 bits		4 bytes
long			64 bits		8 bytes

float 			32 bits		4 bytes
double			64 bits		8 bytes

char			16 bits		2 bytes

These are the 8 primitive data types in java.

Data type means primitive data type only. 

Others are objects. They are called as types (not data types)

String str;			str is a String type.		not String data type

Employee rama;			rama is an Employee type. 	not Employee data type


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is meant by for-each loop?

	for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)			definitive loop
	{
	}

	1 to 10 is not correct choice for "for-each" loop.
	The question is not "for loop". it is "for-each" loop.

Ans:
	For each loop is used to iterate for each element found in a collection (or array)

	int []arr={12,32,34,54,56,67,87,98,91,101};

	for(int x : arr)
	{
		//displays each element in the arr
		System.out.println(x);
	}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between 
	break and continue?

	break exits the loop.
	continue moves to next iteration.

If you ask similarity,
	both of them ignores the remaining lines below

--------------------------------------------------
What is the difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer?

	the only difference between them are that "StringBuffer" is synchronized. But "StringBuilder" is not.
	Otherwise, all the methods and variables found in StringBuilder are exactly found in StringBuffer also.


	Synchronized means, it will not allow multiple threads to access it at a time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is the difference between static and final?
	static member of a class does not belong to any particular instance of the class. 
		class Student
		{
			static String collegeName;		//for all object of class, only 1 collegeName
		}

		all the objects of Student share the same collegeName
		Student.collegeName="KLN";
		Student rama=new Student();
		Student siva=new Student();
		Student kumar=new Student();
		
		all the students have same collegeName
		rama.collegeName="IIT";
		System.out.println(siva.collegeName);		//	IIT


	final 
		variable		CONSTANT
		method			cannot be overriden
		class			cannot be inherited

		that means we cannot change it

-------------------------------
final, finally, finalize
	

	final 
		variable		CONSTANT
		method			cannot be overriden
		class			cannot be inherited

		that means we cannot change it

	finally
		used with 'try' block
		try-finally
		try-catch-finally
		try-catch-catch-finally

		finally block is executed whenever try block is executed. No matter, exception occurred or not, 			handled or not

	finalize
		is a method that can be used to do closing tasks like we do in destructor in c++.
		finalize is executed by garbage collector

------------------------------------------------------------------
OOPS
	Inheritance
	Encapsulation
	Polymorphism
	Abstraction

	Overloading
	Overriding
	Abstract class vs Interfaces
	
----------------------------------------------------
Java 8 features
	Lambda
	Stream API
------------------------------------------------
Java Collections
	List
		ArrayList
		LinkedList
	Set
		HashSet
		TreeSet
		LinkedHashSet
	Map
		HashMap
		TreeMap
		LinkedHashMap

	legacy classes
		Vector
		Hashtable

Difference between Hashtable and HashMap
		Hashtable is synchronized.	But HashMap is not synchronized.
		both are key value pair

		EntrySet in HashMap
			key, value

		how will you loop a map?
